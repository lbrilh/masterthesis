# Feature Selection

This folder contains Python scripts used for feature selection and analysis.

## Overview

- `DSL_*` files relate to the Data Shared Lasso method, which allows for feature selection while considering shared information across datasets.

- `Individual_Lasso_*` files are used for running Lasso regression on individual datasets.

- `Pooled_Lasso_*` files apply Lasso regression across pooled dataset.

- `RF_*` files involve using Random Forests to determine feature importances.

## Directory Structure

- `Feature Selection/`

  - `parquet/`: Contains the parquet files generated by the scripts, which store the coefficients and feature importances calculated.

  - `images/`: Holds the generated plots for the feature importances and Lasso paths.

  - `DSL_barplot.py`: Script to generate bar plots for DSL coefficients.

  - `DSL_coef.py`: Calculates and stores the coefficients for DSL.

  - `DSL_profiles.py`: Plots the DSL profiles of predictor variables.

  - `Individual_Lasso_barplots.py`: Script to generate bar plots for individual Lasso coefficients.

  - `Individual_Lasso_coefs.py`: Calculates and stores the coefficients for individual Lasso.

  - `Lasso_profiles.py`: Script to calculate and plot Lasso profiles of predictor variables.

  - `Pooled_lasso_barplot.py`: Generates bar plots for the coefficients from Pooled Lasso.

  - `Pooled_lasso_coefs.py`: Calculates and stores the coefficients for Pooled Lasso.

  - `RF_coefs_barplot.py`: Script to calculate and plot feature importances using Random Forest.

  - `constants.py`: Contains constants used across the scripts.

  - `preprocessing.py`: Handles preprocessing of datasets for feature selection methods.
