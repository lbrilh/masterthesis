# Magging 

This folder contains Python scripts for implementing and analyzing a Magging estimator, a statistical learning technique used for creating and evaluating ensemble models.

## Contents

- `constants.py`: Defines numerical and categorical features used across models.
- `cv_datasets.py`: Handles cross-validation for Magging estimators and calculates optimal penalty terms.
- `Diagnostics.py`: Provides diagnostic tools such as residual plots and Cook's Distance for Magging models.
- `empirical_magging.py`: Empirical calculation and validation of Magging estimators.
- `linear_magging.py`: Tests linear Magging models and outlines future development directions.
- `magging.py`: Core implementation of the Magging estimator extending sklearn's `BaseEstimator`.
- `magging_dsl_comparison.py`: Compares Magging against Data-Shared Lasso using artificial data.
- `optimal_penalty.py`: Searches for optimal penalty terms within the Magging framework.
- `plotting.py`: Generates various plots including boxplots and KDE plots for data analysis.

### Subdirectories

- `__pycache__`: Contains Python cache files.
- `estimators`: Contains saved model estimators or relevant data for the Magging models.
- `images`: Stores images or figures generated by the scripts, possibly including plots.
- `parquet`: Contains data files in Parquet format used by the scripts.
